#### _**1. When I open Windows Explorer through Ubuntu, it goes to a different folder than in the guide**_

Please make sure:

- you are running the command `explorer.exe .` including the dot at the end.
- you are running Windows 10 version `1909` or newer.

#### _**2. Ubuntu on Windows 10 high CPU usage, crashes**_

- Make sure you are running Windows 10 version `1909` or newer.
- Then, try following [these steps](https://teckangaroo.com/enable-windows-10-virtual-machine-platform/)

#### ___3. When I pull from the `ds-prep-course-2023` repository, I get an error___

If you get an error like the following when pulling:

```
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
<some files>
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
```

what _git_ is telling you is that changes were made by you to the files on the `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023` folder, and is not pulling the changes made by the instructors because they would override the changes that you made there.

To fix this do the following:

1. Make sure that any change you made to the files on `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023`  (that you don't want to lose) is saved in your `~/projects/ds-prep-workspace` repository (refer to [Updates to Learning Units](#3-updates-to-learning-units) on how to do this), and if you don't want to keep the changes you made to these files, just continue on to the next step;
2. Go to the `~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023` folder and run:

    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023
    git stash
    ```

3. Now you can pull from the `ds-prep-course-2023` repository:

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

#### ___4. When I try to open `jupyter notebook`, I get an error___

If you get this error when trying to open a notebook:

```bash
migs-MBP% jupyter notebook
zsh: command not found: jupyter
```

make sure to activate your virtual environment **before** opening `jupyter notebook`:

```bash
source ~/.virtualenvs/prep-venv/bin/activate
```

#### ___5. When I use the `cp` command the `>` sign appears and the command does not execute___

```bash
cp -r ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2023/‚ÄúWeek 00" ds-prep-workspace
>
```

Make sure to use this type of quotes `"` and not these ones `‚Äú`.

#### _**6. When setting up python 3.8 I get an error**_

When I run this command:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

I get this error:

```bash
W: GPG error: http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt focal-pgdg InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
```

Solution: Take the id in front of `NO_PUBKEY` (in my case its `7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8`) and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
```

#### _**7. Nothing happens when I type my password**_

In **step two** it asks me for the computer password. However, I am not being able to write anything

Solution:
When you write your password you might not get any visual feedback and that's okay! Write it as normal and hit <kbd>enter</kbd> when you're done!

#### _**8. I still have a NotImplemented error**_

I've completed the exercise in the Exercise Notebook but when I run the cell I get a **NotImplementedError**.

Solution:
The `raise NotImplementedError()` are added to the exercise cell as a placeholder for where you're supposed to add your solution/code. It is meant to be removed!
